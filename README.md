Project created for learning purposes.

Tried a lot of SaSS cool stuff :)

For you to be able to see the project you just need to clone the project, run the 'npm install' command, this will only add the 'node-sass' package that is used as a dev dependencie.

If you want to see the project just open the index.html file
